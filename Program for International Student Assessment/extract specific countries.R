# the program for international student assessment download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2009 student questionnaire tables

# sqlite database-backed survey objects are described here: 
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/svy-dbi.html
# monet database-backed survey objects are similar, but:
# the database engine is, well, blazingly faster
# the setup is kinda more complicated (but all done for you)

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)
# as shown in the load() examples below.
