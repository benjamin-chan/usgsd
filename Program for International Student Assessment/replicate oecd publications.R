# first: specify your batfile.  again, mine looks like this:
# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/PISA/MonetDB/pisa.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `pisa.bat` might be `pisa.sh` instead

# second: run the MonetDB server

# third: your five lines to make a monet database connection.
# just like above, mine look like this:
dbname <- "pisa"
dbport <- 50007

monet.url <- paste0( "monetdb://localhost:" , dbport , "/" , dbname )
db <- dbConnect( MonetDB.R() , monet.url , wait = TRUE )


# # # # run your analysis commands # # # #


# the program for international student assessment download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2009 student questionnaire tables

# sqlite database-backed survey objects are described here: 
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/svy-dbi.html
# monet database-backed survey objects are similar, but:
# the database engine is, well, blazingly faster
# the setup is kinda more complicated (but all done for you)

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)
# as shown in the load() examples below.

# load the desired program for international student assessment monet database-backed complex sample design objects

# uncomment one this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# load( 'C:/My Directory/PISA/2009 int_stq09_dec11.rda' )	# analyze the 2009 student questionnaire


# note: this r data file should contain five sqlrepdesign objects ending with `imp1` - `imp5`
# you can check 'em out by running the `ls()` function to see what's available in working memory.
ls()
# see them?
# they should be named something like this..
paste0( 'int_stq09_dec11_imp' , 1:5 )

# now use `mget` to take a character vector,
# look for objects with the same names,
# and smush 'em all together into a list
imp.list <- mget( paste0( 'int_stq09_dec11_imp' , 1:5 ) )

# now take a deep breath because this next part might scare you.

# use the custom-made `svyMDBdesign` function to put
# those five database-backed tables (already smushed into a list object)
# into a new and sexy object type - a monetdb-backed, multiply-imputed svrepdesign object.
pisa.imp <- svyMDBdesign( imp.list )
# note to database-connection buffs out there: this function does the port `open`ing for you.


# for the most part, `pisa.imp` can be used like a hybrid multiply-imputed, sqlrepsurvey object.


# print the overall reading score for all students in the entire data set.

# note that this includes non-oecd countries, so it doesn't match the oecd's powerpoint slide
MIcombine( with( pisa.imp , svymean( ~readz ) ) )


##########################################
# okay time to start replicating numbers #
##########################################


# on slide number two, take a look at the "total oecd" row's mean and standard error
# (first column with statistics)

# break out `pisa.imp` by oecd- and non-oecd students.
MIcombine( with( pisa.imp , svymean( ~readz , byvar = ~oecd ) ) )
# boom!  matches precisely.


# subset `pisa.imp` like you'd subset any other survey object.
oecd.imp <- subset( pisa.imp , oecd == 1 )
# now you've got an `oecd.imp` object restricted to only oecd students

# re-run the mean and standard error of the reading score,
# this time using the monetdb-backed object that's been subsetted already..
MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svymean( ~readz ) ) )
# ..and it exactly matches again, hooray!

# break out the oecd students' reading scores by gender
MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svymean( ~readz , byvar = ~st04q01 ) ) )
# exactly match.  nice.

# let's run that same command as above, but store the results into a `oecd.boygirl` object
oecd.boygirl <- MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svymean( ~readz , byvar = ~st04q01 ) ) )

# now the `survey` package's `svycontrast` function can be used.
# note oecd.boygirl has three levels: NA, 1, and 2.
# NA is first in the list, so that's a zero.
# boys are next, and we want to compare them to girls, so make them negative one
# and girls (the third level) a positive one.  again, that's (zero, negative one, positive one)
# put it into the diff= position inside a list in the second position of `svycontrast`
svycontrast( oecd.boygirl , list( diff = c( 0 , -1 , 1 ) ) )
# and boo-yah, you have just replicated the powerpoint slide's difference boy minus girl and also standard error.

# was that too much for you?  if you've only got two levels,
# just use this custom function i've written *just for you*
# that performs a simple t-test on monetdb-backed, multiply-imputed designs
pisa.svyttest( readz ~ st04q01 , oecd.imp )
# see?
# same difference.



#################
# quantile time #


# quantiles require a bit of extra work in monetdb-backed multiply-imputed designs
# here's an example of how to calculate the median reading score
sqlquantile.MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svyquantile( ~readz , 0.5 , se = TRUE ) ) )
# the `MIcombine` function does not work on (svyquantile x sqlrepdesign) output
# so i've written a custom function `sqlquantile.MIcombine` that does.  kewl?


# hey how about we loop through the six quantiles shown on the powerpoint's slide two..
for ( qtile in c( 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.75 , 0.9 , 0.95 ) ){

	# ..and run the reading score for each of those quantiles.
	print( sqlquantile.MIcombine( with( oecd.imp , svyquantile( ~readz , qtile , se = TRUE ) ) ) )
	# compared to the powerpoint, the coefficients match exactly..however the standard errors are not exactly the same
	# why not?  because there's an element of randomness in quantile calculations using big big big data.
	
}

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# quantile standard error difference explanation  #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# standard error computation for quantiles of very large data sets requires an element of randomness
# therefore, these SEs will not precisely match the official recommendations.  but there's no theoretical basis
# that one answer is better than another.

# from the oecd's recommended sas scripts - http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2006/42628103.zip
# notice the random numbers used in their quantile calculations?  the normal() function in sas injects some randomness in the result.

# DATA QUARTILE_TEMP1 (KEEP=&BYVAR &REPLI_ROOT.0-&REPLI_ROOT.80 &PV_ROOT.1-&PV_ROOT.5 INDEX1-INDEX5 &ID_SCHOOL &INDEX NB_MISS) ;
	# SET &INFILE;
	# NB_MISS=0;
	# ARRAY A (6) &INDEX &PV_ROOT.1-&PV_ROOT.5;
	# DO I=1 TO 6;
		# IF (A(I) IN (.,.M,.N,.I)) THEN NB_MISS=NB_MISS+1;
	# END;
	# INDEX1=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-01));
	# INDEX2=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-23));
	# INDEX3=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-45));
	# INDEX4=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-67));
	# INDEX5=&INDEX + (0.01*normal(-89));
# RUN;

# so yeah, there's no way that r + monetdb can precisely match sas.  but who cares.  both results are defensible.
