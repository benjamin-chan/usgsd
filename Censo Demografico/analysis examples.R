# lines of code to hold on to for all other `censo_demografico` monetdb analyses #

# first: specify your batfile.  again, mine looks like this:
# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/CENSO/MonetDB/censo_demografico.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `censo_demografico.bat` might be `censo_demografico.sh` instead

# second: run the MonetDB server
pid <- monetdb.server.start( batfile )

# third: your five lines to make a monet database connection.
# just like above, mine look like this:
dbname <- "censo_demografico"
dbport <- 50011

monet.url <- paste0( "monetdb://localhost:" , dbport , "/" , dbname )
db <- dbConnect( MonetDB.R() , monet.url , wait = TRUE )

# if you are running windows, you might see a performance improvement
# by turning off multi-threading with this command:
if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") dbSendQuery( db , "set optimizer = 'sequential_pipe';" )
# this must be set every time you start the server.

# # # # run your analysis commands # # # #



# to turn multi-threading back on (this is the default)
# either shut down and re-start the server
# with monetdb.server.stop then monetdb.server.start
# or simply run this line:
# dbSendQuery( db , "set optimizer = 'default_pipe';" )


# the censo demografico download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2010 person-level table

# sqlite database-backed survey objects are described here: 
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/svy-dbi.html
# monet database-backed survey objects are similar, but:
# the database engine is, well, blazingly faster
# the setup is kinda more complicated (but all done for you)

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)


# uncomment this line by removing the `#` to load the person-level table..
# load( 'C:/My Directory/CENSO/pes 2010 design.rda' )
# ..and immediately connect the complex sample designs to the monet database #
pes.d <- open( pes.design , driver = MonetDB.R() , wait = TRUE )


# alternatively, open and connect to the household-level design with these two lines instead
# load( 'C:/My Directory/CENSO/dom 2010 design.rda' )
# dom.d <- open( dom.design , driver = MonetDB.R() , wait = TRUE )

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in the 2010 census #

# simply use the nrow function..
nrow( pes.d )

# ..on the sqlsurvey design object

# since the the 2010 census gets loaded as a monet database-backed survey object instead of a data frame,
# the number of unweighted records cannot be calculated by running the nrow() function on a data frame.

# running the nrow() function on the database connection object
# simply produces an error..
# nrow( db )

# because the monet database might contain multiple data tables
class( db )


# instead, perform the same unweighted count directly from the sql table
# stored inside the monet database on your hard disk (as opposed to RAM)
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_records FROM c10" )

	

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in the 2010 census #
# broken out by state #

# note: this is easiest by simply running a sql query on the monet database directly
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT v0001 , COUNT(*) as num_records FROM c10 GROUP BY v0001" )

# or, if you'd prefer results ordered by state, then say so!
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT v0001 , COUNT(*) as num_records FROM c10 GROUP BY v0001 ORDER BY v0001" )



# count the weighted number of individuals in the 2010 census #

# note that this should be calculated by summing up the weight variable
# from the original database (.db) file connection
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT SUM( pes_wgt ) AS sum_weights FROM c10" )


# the total 2010 population of brazil
# by state

dbGetQuery( db , 'SELECT SUM( pes_wgt * v6033 ) / SUM( pes_wgt ) AS mean_age FROM c10 WHERE v6033 < 900' )

# using syntax that matches the R survey package:

# median age of all brazilians
svyquantile( ~v6033 , subset( pes.d , v6033 < 900 ) , quantiles = 0.5 )
# note: quantile standard errors cannot be computed with taylor-series linearization designs
# this is true in both the survey and sqlsurvey packages

# note two additional differences between the sqlsurvey and survey packages..

# ..sqlsurvey designs do not allow multiple quantiles.  instead, 
# loop through and print or save multiple quantiles, simply use a for loop

# loop through the median and 99th percentiles and print both results to the screen
for ( i in c( .5 , .99 ) ) print( svyquantile( ~v6033 , subset( pes.d , v6033 < 900 ) , quantiles = i ) )



# ..sqlsurvey designs do not allow byvar arguments, meaning the only way to 
# calculate quantiles by state would be by creating subsets for each subpopulation
# and calculating the quantiles for them independently:

# restrict the pes.d object to females only
