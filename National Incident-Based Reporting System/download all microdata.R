# warning: this takes a while #
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# even if you're only downloading a single extract and you've got a fast internet connection,
# you'll be better off leaving this script to run overnight.  if you wanna download all available files and years,
# leave it running on friday afternoon (or even better: before you leave for a weeklong vacation).
# depending on your internet and processor speeds, the entire script should take between two and ten days.
# it's running.  don't believe me?  check the working directory (set below) for a new r data file (.rda) every few hours.





# set your working directory.
# all NIBRS data files will be stored here
# after downloading.
# use forward slashes instead of back slashes

# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# setwd( "C:/My Directory/NIBRS/" )
# ..in order to set your current working directory



# remove the # in order to run this install.packages line only once
# install.packages( c( "SAScii" , "RCurl" , "descr" , "downloader" , "R.utils" , "stringr" ) )



library(SAScii) 	# load the SAScii package (imports ascii data with a SAS script)
library(RCurl)		# load RCurl package (downloads https files)
library(stringr)	# load stringr package (manipulates character strings easily)
library(downloader)	# downloads and then runs the source() function on scripts from github
library(MonetDB.R)	# load MonetDB.R package (creates database files in R)
library(descr)		# load the descr package (converts fixed-width files to delimited files)
library(R.utils)	# load the R.utils package (counts the number of lines in a file quickly)
library(foreign)	# load foreign package (converts data files into R)


# configure a monetdb database for the nibrs on windows #

# note: only run this command once.  this creates an executable (.bat) file
# in the appropriate directory on your local disk.
# when adding new files or adding a new year of data, this script does not need to be re-run.

# create a monetdb executable (.bat) file for the national incident-based reporting system
batfile <-
	monetdb.server.setup(
					
					# set the path to the directory where the initialization batch file and all data will be stored
					database.directory = paste0( getwd() , "/MonetDB" ) ,
					# must be empty or not exist
					
					# find the main path to the monetdb installation program
					monetdb.program.path = 
						ifelse(

					# for other operating systems, it's usually part of the PATH and therefore can simply be left blank.
										
					# choose a database name
					dbname = "nibrs" ,
					
					# choose a database port
					# this port should not conflict with other monetdb databases
					# on your local computer.  two databases with the same port number
					# cannot be accessed at the same time
					dbport = 50014
	)

	
# this next step is so very important.

# store a line of code that will make it easy to open up the monetdb server in the future.
# this should contain the same file path as the batfile created above,
# you're best bet is to actually look at your local disk to find the full filepath of the executable (.bat) file.
# if you ran this script without changes, the batfile will get stored in C:\My Directory\NIBRS\MonetDB\nibrs.bat

# here's the batfile location:
batfile

# note that since you only run the `monetdb.server.setup()` function the first time this script is run,
# you will need to note the location of the batfile for future MonetDB analyses!

# in future R sessions, you can create the batfile variable with a line like..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/NIBRS/MonetDB/nibrs.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `nibrs.bat` might be `nibrs.sh` instead
# obviously, without the `#` comment character

# hold on to that line for future scripts.
# you need to run this line *every time* you access
# the national incident-based reporting system files with monetdb.
# this is the monetdb server.

# two other things you need: the database name and the database port.
# store them now for later in this script, but hold on to them for other scripts as well
dbname <- "nibrs"
dbport <- 50014

# now the local windows machine contains a new executable program at "c:\my directory\nibrs\monetdb\nibrs.bat"




# it's recommended that after you've _created_ the monetdb server,
# you create a block of code like the one below to _access_ the monetdb server

# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/NIBRS/MonetDB/nibrs.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `nibrs.bat` might be `nibrs.sh` instead

# second: run the MonetDB server
