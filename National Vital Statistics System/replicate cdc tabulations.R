# options( "monetdb.sequential" = TRUE )		# # only windows users need this line
# -- whenever connecting to a monetdb server,

library(MonetDB.R)	# load the MonetDB.R package (connects r to a monet database)


# in most monetdb scripts, specifying the .bat file (to launch the server) suffices
# however, since the fetal death files are stored in R data files (.rda) on the local disk,
# any usage of those files also requires that the working directory be specified.
# setwd( "C:/My Directory/NVSS/" )
# uncomment the line above (remove the `#`) to set the working directory to C:\My Directory\NVSS


# after running the r script above, users should have handy a few lines

# second: run the MonetDB server
