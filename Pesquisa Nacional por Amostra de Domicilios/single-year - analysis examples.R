# important note about why these statistics and standard errors do not precisely match the table packages available at:   #
# ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Trabalho_e_Rendimento/Pesquisa_Nacional_por_Amostra_de_Domicilios_anual/2011/Sintese_Indicadores/ #
# the brazilian institute of statistics round the post-stratifed weights, which has no theoretical effect. so these final #
# results from this script will be very close but not precisely exact. however, you can view the replication script in    #
# this directory which explains how these statistics *do* precisely match some statistics, standard errors, and           #
# coefficients of variation provided to me by the friendly folks at IBGE in other words, the analysis methods described   #
# in this script are methodologically justified and can safely be viewed as the correct way of doing things.              #
