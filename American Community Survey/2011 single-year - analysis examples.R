# after running the r script above, users should have handy a few lines
# to initiate and connect to the monet database containing all american community survey tables
# run them now.  mine look like this:


####################################################################
# lines of code to hold on to for all other `acs` monetdb analyses #

# first: specify your batfile.  again, mine looks like this:
# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/ACS/MonetDB/acs.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `acs.bat` might be `acs.sh` instead

# second: run the MonetDB server
pid <- monetdb.server.start( batfile )

# third: your five lines to make a monet database connection.
# just like above, mine look like this:
dbname <- "acs"
dbport <- 50001

monet.url <- paste0( "monetdb://localhost:" , dbport , "/" , dbname )
db <- dbConnect( MonetDB.R() , monet.url , wait = TRUE )


# # # # run your analysis commands # # # #


# the american community survey download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2011 single-year table

# sqlite database-backed survey objects are described here: 
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/svy-dbi.html
# monet database-backed survey objects are similar, but:
# the database engine is, well, blazingly faster
# the setup is kinda more complicated (but all done for you)

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)
# as shown in the load() examples below.

# choose which file in your ACS directory to analyze:
# one-year, three-year, or five-year file from any of the available years.
# this script replicates the 2011 single-year estimates,
# so leave that line uncommented and the other three choices commented out.

# load the desired american community survey monet database-backed complex sample design objects

# uncomment one of these lines by removing the `#` at the front..
# load( 'C:/My Directory/ACS/acs2011_1yr.rda' )	# analyze the 2011 single-year acs
# load( 'C:/My Directory/ACS/acs2010_1yr.rda' )	# analyze the 2010 single-year acs
# load( 'C:/My Directory/ACS/acs2010_3yr.rda' )	# analyze the 2008-2010 three-year acs
# load( 'C:/My Directory/ACS/acs2010_5yr.rda' )	# analyze the 2006-2010 five-year acs

# note: this r data file should already contain both the merged (person + household) and household-only designs


# connect the complex sample designs to the monet database #
acs.m <- open( acs.m.design , driver = MonetDB.R() , wait = TRUE )	# merged design
acs.h <- open( acs.h.design , driver = MonetDB.R() , wait = TRUE )	# household-only design



################################################
# ..and immediately start the example analyses #
################################################

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in acs #

# simply use the nrow function..
nrow( acs.m )

# ..on the sqlrepsurvey design object
class( acs.m )


# since the acs gets loaded as a monet database-backed survey object instead of a data frame,
# the number of unweighted records cannot be calculated by running the nrow() function on a data frame.

# running the nrow() function on the database connection object
# simply produces an error..
# nrow( db )

# because the monet database might contain multiple data tables
class( db )


# instead, perform the same unweighted count directly from the sql table
# stored inside the monet database on your hard disk (as opposed to RAM)
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_records FROM acs2011_1yr_m" )

	

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in acs #
# broken out by state #

# note: this is easiest by simply running a sql query on the monet database directly
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT st , COUNT(*) as num_records FROM acs2011_1yr_m GROUP BY st" )



# count the weighted number of individuals in acs #

# the population of the united states (including group quarters residents: both institionalized and non-institutionalized) #
svytotal( ~one , acs.m )

# note that this is exactly equivalent to summing up the weight variable
# from the original database (.db) file connection
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT SUM( pwgtp ) AS sum_weights FROM acs2011_1yr_m" )


# the population of the united states #
# by state
svytotal( ~one , acs.m , byvar = ~st )
# note: the above command is one example of how the r survey package differs from the r sqlsurvey package


# calculate the mean of a linear variable #

# average age - nationwide
svymean( ~agep , acs.m )

# by state
svymean( ~agep , acs.m , byvar = ~st )


# calculate the distribution of a categorical variable #

# HICOV has been converted to a factor (categorical) variable
# instead of a numeric (linear) variable,
# because it only contains the values 1 and 2.
# when the acs.m object was created with the function sqlrepdesign()
# the check.factors parameter was left at the default of ten,
# meaning all numeric columns with ten or fewer distinct values
# would be automatically converted to factors

# percent uninsured - nationwide
svymean( ~hicov , acs.m )

# by state
svymean( ~hicov , acs.m , byvar = ~st )


# calculate the median and other percentiles #

# median age of residents of the united states
svyquantile( ~agep , acs.m , , quantiles = 0.5 , se = T )

# note two additional differences between the sqlsurvey and survey packages..

# ..sqlrepsurvey designs do not allow multiple quantiles.  instead, 
# loop through and print or save multiple quantiles, simply use a for loop

# loop through the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles and print each result to the screen
for ( i in c( .25 , .5 , .75 ) ) print( svyquantile( ~agep , acs.m , quantiles = i , se = TRUE ) )


# ..sqlrepsurvey designs do not allow byvar arguments, meaning the only way to 
# calculate quantiles by state would be by creating subsets for each subpopulation
# and calculating the quantiles for them independently:

######################
# subsetting example #
######################

# restrict the acs.m object to females only
acs.m.female <- subset( acs.m , sex == 2 )

# now any of the above commands can be re-run
# using the acs.m.female object
# instead of the acs.m object
# in order to analyze females only
	
# calculate the mean of a linear variable #

# average age - nationwide, restricted to females
svymean( ~agep , acs.m.female )

# median age - nationwide, restricted to females
svyquantile( ~agep , acs.m.female , quantiles = 0.5 , se = T )
