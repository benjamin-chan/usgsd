# all 2008 BSA comma separated value (.csv) files

# so if all 2008 BSA files are stored in C:\My Directory\BSAPUF\2008\
# set this directory to C:/My Directory/BSAPUF/
# use forward slashes instead of back slashes

# setwd( "C:/My Directory/BSAPUF/" )


# set the current year of data to import
year <- 2008


# note: the MonetDB folder should *not* be within a year-specific directory.
# multiple bsa puf years will all be stored into the same monet database,
# in order to allow multi-year analyses.
# although the csv download script changed the working directory to a single year of data,
# this importation will include all monetdb files into a single database folder


# configure a monetdb database for the bsa pufs on windows #

# note: only run this command once.  this creates an executable (.bat) file
# in the appropriate directory on your local disk.
# when adding new files or adding a new year of data, this script does not need to be re-run.

# create a monetdb executable (.bat) file for the medicare basic stand alone public use file
batfile <-
	monetdb.server.setup(
					
					# set the path to the directory where the initialization batch file and all data will be stored
					database.directory = paste0( getwd() , "/MonetDB" ) ,

					# note: for windows, monetdb usually gets stored in the program files directory
					# for other operating systems, it's usually part of the PATH and therefore can simply be left blank.
					
					# choose a database name
					dbname = "bsapuf" ,
					
					# choose a database port
					# this port should not conflict with other monetdb databases
					# on your local computer.  two databases with the same port number
					# cannot be accessed at the same time
					dbport = 50003
	)

	
# this next step is so very important.

# store a line of code that will make it easy to open up the monetdb server in the future.
# this should contain the same file path as the batfile created above,
# you're best bet is to actually look at your local disk to find the full filepath of the executable (.bat) file.
# if you ran this script without changes, the batfile will get stored in C:\My Directory\BSAPUF\MonetDB\bsapuf.bat

# here's the batfile location:
batfile

# note that since you only run the `monetdb.server.setup()` function the first time this script is run,
# you will need to note the location of the batfile for future MonetDB analyses!

# in future R sessions, you can create the batfile variable with a line like..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/BSAPUF/MonetDB/bsapuf.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `bsapuf.bat` might be `bsapuf.sh` instead
# obviously, without the `#` comment character

# hold on to that line for future scripts.
# you need to run this line *every time* you access
# the basic stand alone public use files with monetdb.
# this is the monetdb server.

# two other things you need: the database name and the database port.
# store them now for later in this script, but hold on to them for other scripts as well
dbname <- "bsapuf"
dbport <- 50003


# hey try running it now!  a shell window should pop up.
pid <- monetdb.server.start( batfile )
# store the result into another variable, which stands for process id
# this `pid` variable will allow the MonetDB server to be terminated from within R automagically.
