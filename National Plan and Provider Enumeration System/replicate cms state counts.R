# this r script will create the state x count table available at:
# https://raw.github.com/ajdamico/usgsd/master/National%20Plan%20and%20Provider%20Enumeration%20System/replication%20of%20CMS-provided%20state%20counts%20from%20PUF.csv

# which replicated the "May 2013" counts table provided to me by
# the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms), available at:
# https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd/blob/master/National%20Plan%20and%20Provider%20Enumeration%20System/Public%20File%20May%202013.xlsx?raw=true

# here's some additional detail from the folks at cms regarding this file:
#
# This spreadsheet will contain three tabs. 
# 1. Data in the first tab is provided from the public file which has the breakdown by state.
#	The state for ‘54847’ records are recorded as empty.
#	These ‘54847’ records are the deactivated NPIs.
# 2. Second tab has the data for the ‘54847’ deactivated NPIs with state breakdown.
#	This data was taken from NPPES Production database.
# 3. Third tab is the result of combining data from tabs 1 and 2, which the user is interested in.
#
# Notes:
# 1. Outside analysts cannot reproduce the data provided in the second/third tab
#	as the business requirement only allows limited data for the deactivated records.
# 2. If the users want to categorize these deactivated NPIs (Tab2 data) by deactivation date,
#	they can use the column "NPI Deactivation Date" as a filter only for these records.
