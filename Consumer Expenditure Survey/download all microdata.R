############################################################
# download all available Consumer Expenditure Survey files #
# with R then save every file as an R data frame (.rda)    #
############################################################


# set your working directory.
# all CES files will be stored here
# after downloading and importing it.
# use forward slashes instead of back slashes

# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# setwd( "C:/My Directory/CES/" )
# ..in order to set your current working directory



library(foreign) 	# load foreign package (converts data files into R)


# uncomment this line to download all available data sets
# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front
# years.to.download <- 2013:1997

# uncomment to only download the most current available year
# years.to.download <- 2013
# but why not just download them all?  ;)



# conversion options #

# it's recommended you keep a version of the .rda files,
# since they work with all subsequent scripts

# do you want to save an R data file (.rda) to the working directory?

# do you want to save a stata-readable file (.dta) to the working directory?

# do you want to save a comma-separated values file (.csv) to the working directory?
