# run them now.  mine look like this:


######################################################################
# lines of code to hold on to for all other `brfss` monetdb analyses #

# first: specify your batfile.  again, mine looks like this:
# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/BRFSS/MonetDB/brfss.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `brfss.bat` might be `brfss.sh` instead

# second: run the MonetDB server
pid <- monetdb.server.start( batfile )

# third: your five lines to make a monet database connection.
# just like above, mine look like this:
dbname <- "brfss"
dbport <- 50004

monet.url <- paste0( "monetdb://localhost:" , dbport , "/" , dbname )
db <- dbConnect( MonetDB.R() , monet.url , wait = TRUE )


# # # # run your analysis commands # # # #


# the behavioral risk factor surveillance system download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2010 single-year table

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)
# as shown in the load() examples below.

# choose which single-year file in your BRFSS directory to analyze
# this script replicates the 2010 single-year estimates,
# so uncomment that line and the other three choices commented out.

# load the desired behavioral risk factor surveillance system monet database-backed complex sample design objects

# uncomment one of these lines by removing the `#` at the front..
# load( 'C:/My Directory/BRFSS/b2010 design.rda' )	# analyze the 2010 single-year acs
# load( 'C:/My Directory/BRFSS/b2011 design.rda' )	# analyze the 2011 single-year acs
# load( 'C:/My Directory/BRFSS/b2009 design.rda' )	# analyze the 2009 single-year acs
# load( 'C:/My Directory/BRFSS/b1984 design.rda' )	# analyze the 1984 single-year acs

# note: this r data file should already contain the 2010 single-year design

# if you wnated to use an unedited version of this, you could simply #
# connect the complex sample designs to the monet database like this: #
# brfss.d <- open( brfss.design , driver = MonetDB.R() )	# single-year design

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# numeric-to-factor conversion  #

# however, the 'asthma' column is coded as numeric 
# in the importation sas script for the 2010 brfss
# http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2010/sasout10.sas
# so that needs to be converted over to a factor.

# the variable `asthmst` was imported as a numeric variable
# the sqlsurvey package cannot convert numeric variables to factors
# on-the-fly, so instead just re-run the survey design object line

# the one object that needs to be modified is the check.factors table
# it's stored here
brfss.design$zdata

# extract only the non-numeric columns
all.cols <- sapply( brfss.design$zdata , 'class' )
fac.cols <- names( all.cols[ !( all.cols %in% c( 'numeric' , 'integer' ) ) ] )
# now you have a character string..
fac.cols
# containing all of the columns that are non-numeric already.

# now simply add the asthma column to it.
fac.cols <- c( fac.cols , 'xasthmst' )


# and re-run the brfss.design object.
# take a look at the old design to get most of your variables..

brfss.d <-
	sqlsurvey(
		weight = brfss.design$weights ,		# weight variable column (defined in the character string above)
		nest = TRUE ,						# whether or not psus are nested within strata
		strata = brfss.design$strata ,		# stratification variable column (defined in the character string above)
		id = brfss.design$id ,				# sampling unit column (defined in the character string above)
