######################################################################
# lines of code to hold on to for all other `brfss` monetdb analyses #

# first: specify your batfile.  again, mine looks like this:
# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/BRFSS/MonetDB/brfss.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `brfss.bat` might be `brfss.sh` instead

# second: run the MonetDB server
pid <- monetdb.server.start( batfile )

# third: your five lines to make a monet database connection.
# just like above, mine look like this:
dbname <- "brfss"
dbport <- 50004

monet.url <- paste0( "monetdb://localhost:" , dbport , "/" , dbname )
db <- dbConnect( MonetDB.R() , monet.url , wait = TRUE )


# # # # run your analysis commands # # # #


# the behavioral risk factor surveillance system download and importation script
# has already created a monet database-backed survey design object
# connected to the 2011 single-year table

# sqlite database-backed survey objects are described here: 
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/svy-dbi.html
# monet database-backed survey objects are similar, but:
# the database engine is, well, blazingly faster
# the setup is kinda more complicated (but all done for you)

# since this script only loads one file off of the local drive,
# there's no need to set the working directory.
# instead, simply use the full filepath to the r data file (.rda)
# as shown in the load() examples below.


# choose which single-year file in your BRFSS directory to analyze
# this script replicates the 2011 single-year estimates,
# so leave that line uncommented and the other three choices commented out.

# load the desired behavioral risk factor surveillance system monet database-backed complex sample design objects

# note: this r data file should already contain the 2011 single-year design


# if the column classes are already correct, you could use this line -

# connect the complex sample designs to the monet database #
# brfss.d <- open( brfss.design , driver = MonetDB.R() , wait = TRUE )	# single-year design

# - but they're not (at least for these analysis examples),
# so you have to run three quick recodes


################################################################################################
# create a new survey design object with the variables you're going to use as character/factor #

# this process runs much faster if you create a character vector containing all non-numeric columns
# otherwise, just set `check.factors = 10` within the sqlsurvey function and it take a guess at which columns
# are character strings or factor variables and which columns should be treated as numbers

# step 1: load the pre-recoded (previous) design 

# uncomment this line by removing the `#` at the front..
# load( 'C:/My Directory/BRFSS/b2011 design.rda' )	# analyze the 2011 single-year brfss

# step 2: extract the character columns
all.classes <- sapply( brfss.design$zdata , class )
factor.columns <- names( all.classes[ !( all.classes %in% c( 'integer' , 'numeric' ) ) ] )

# since we're going to use the uninsured, medical cost, and sex variables in this analysis
# and the cdc's sas code has these variables listed as numeric not character strings..
# http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2011/SASOUT11_LLCP.SAS
# ..they need to be converted over to character
factor.columns <- c( factor.columns , 'hlthpln1' , 'sex' , 'medcost' )

# step 3: re-create a sqlsurvey complex sample design object

brfss.d <-
	sqlsurvey(
		weight = brfss.design$weight ,
		nest = TRUE ,
		strata = brfss.design$strata ,
		id = brfss.design$id ,
		table.name = brfss.design$table ,						
		key = brfss.design$key ,
		check.factors = factor.columns ,			# specify which columns are non-numeric.. or remove this parameter and sqlsurvey() will guess for you.

################################################

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in brfss #

# simply use the nrow function..
nrow( brfss.d )

# ..on the sqlsurvey design object
class( brfss.d )


# since the brfss gets loaded as a monet database-backed survey object instead of a data frame,
# the number of unweighted records cannot be calculated by running the nrow() function on a data frame.

# running the nrow() function on the database connection object
# simply produces an error..
# nrow( db )

# because the monet database might contain multiple data tables
class( db )


# instead, perform the same unweighted count directly from the sql table
# stored inside the monet database on your hard disk (as opposed to RAM)
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_records FROM b2011" )

	

# count the total (unweighted) number of records in brfss #
# broken out by state #

# note: this is easiest by simply running a sql query on the monet database directly
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT xstate , COUNT(*) as num_records FROM b2011 GROUP BY xstate" )



# count the weighted number of individuals in brfss #

# the adult non-institutionalized population of the united states #
# note that this should be calculated by summing up the weight variable
# from the original database (.db) file connection
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT SUM( xllcpwt ) AS sum_weights FROM b2011" )


# the adult non-institutionalized population of the united states #
# by state
dbGetQuery( db , "SELECT xstate , SUM( xllcpwt ) AS sum_weights FROM b2011 group by xstate" )
# note: the above command is one example of how the r survey package differs from the r sqlsurvey package


# calculate the mean of a linear variable #

# average age - nationwide
svymean( ~age , brfss.d )

# by state
svymean( ~age , brfss.d , byvar = ~xstate )


# calculate the distribution of a categorical variable #

# HLTHPLN1 has been converted to a factor (categorical) variable
# instead of a numeric (linear) variable,
# because it only contains the values 1, 2, 7, and 9
# when the brfss.d object was created with the function sqlrepdesign()
# the check.factors parameter was left at the default of ten,
# meaning all numeric columns with ten or fewer distinct values
# would be automatically converted to factors

# percent uninsured - nationwide
svymean( ~hlthpln1 , brfss.d )

# by state
svymean( ~hlthpln1 , brfss.d , byvar = ~xstate )


# calculate the median and other percentiles #

# median age of residents of the united states
svyquantile( ~age , brfss.d , quantiles = 0.5 )
# note: quantile standard errors cannot be computed with taylor-series linearization designs
# this is true in both the survey and sqlsurvey packages

# note two additional differences between the sqlsurvey and survey packages..

# ..sqlsurvey designs do not allow multiple quantiles.  instead, 
# loop through and print or save multiple quantiles, simply use a for loop

# loop through the median and 99th percentiles and print both results to the screen
for ( i in c( .5 , .99 ) ) print( svyquantile( ~age , brfss.d , quantiles = i ) )



# ..sqlsurvey designs do not allow byvar arguments, meaning the only way to 
# calculate quantiles by state would be by creating subsets for each subpopulation
# and calculating the quantiles for them independently:

# subsetting example #
######################

# restrict the brfss.d object to females only
brfss.d.female <- subset( brfss.d , sex == 2 )

# now any of the above commands can be re-run
# using the brfss.d.female object
# instead of the brfss.d object
# in order to analyze females only
	
# calculate the distribution of a categorical variable #

# percent uninsured - nationwide, restricted to females
svymean( ~hlthpln1 , brfss.d.female )
