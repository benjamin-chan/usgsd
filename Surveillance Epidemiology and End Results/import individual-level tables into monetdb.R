# this next step is so very important.

# store a line of code that will make it easy to open up the monetdb server in the future.
# this should contain the same file path as the batfile created above,
# you're best bet is to actually look at your local disk to find the full filepath of the executable (.bat) file.
# if you ran this script without changes, the batfile will get stored in C:\My Directory\SEER\MonetDB\seer.bat

# here's the batfile location:
batfile

# note that since you only run the `monetdb.server.setup()` function the first time this script is run,
# you will need to note the location of the batfile for future MonetDB analyses!

# in future R sessions, you can create the batfile variable with a line like..
# batfile <- "C:/My Directory/SEER/MonetDB/seer.bat"		# # note for mac and *nix users: `seer.bat` might be `seer.sh` instead
# obviously, without the `#` comment character

# hold on to that line for future scripts.
# you need to run this line *every time* you access
# the surveillance epidemiology and end results program files with monetdb.
# this is the monetdb server.

# two other things you need: the database name and the database port.
# store them now for later in this script, but hold on to them for other scripts as well
dbname <- "seer"
